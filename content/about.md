## Education

I am graduate of Wroclaw University of Sience and Technology with"
a Master's degree from _electronics and telecommunication_ in 2007
and a Master's degree from _software engineering_ in 2013.

## Work
Since novemer 2010 I worked for [OVH](https://ovh.pl). I started as technical
expert at 1st line technical support. After few years I moved to R&D team and I
started my journey as a software and devops engineer in [Public
Cloud](https://www.ovh.co.uk/public-cloud/instances/) R&D team where I first
time heard about [OpenStack](https://openstack.org).

In OVH I was working on first OpenStack based cloud offer called Runabove,
and later also their Public Cloud offers. I was working with puppet modules to prepare
deployment system as well as python's code to fix bugs which we found in
OpenStack code or to add some features which we needed in those days.

Later, in 2018 I joined Red Hat to work as a developer of OpenStack Neutron
project.
In Red Hat I am working on maintaining and developing new features in upstream
OpenStack Neutron project as well as on Red Hat's product based on OpenStack,
called OSP.

## Opensource
Since 2015 I am also upstream OpenStack developer. I am contributung mostly to
[OpenStack Neutron](https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/) and [OpenStack
SDK/Shade](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstacksdk/latest/) projects.

Since december 2017 I am member of Neutron's and SDK's core teams.
I am also lead of Neutron CI subteam where I maintain OpenStack Neutron's CI
systemts to allow other developers test and merge their patches as fast as
possible.

In September 2018 I became member of [Neutron drivers
team](https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/pike/contributor/policies/neutron-teams.html#drivers-team).

In September 2019 I was choosen to be Neutron PTL (Project Team Lead) and I will
be serving as PTL for
[Ussuri](https://releases.openstack.org/ussuri/schedule.html) development cycle.

I am also one of liaisons in [First Contact SIG](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/First_Contact_SIG)
for OpenStack Neutron, so if You have any questions or need any help with using
Neutron and/or contributing to this project, please contact me.
