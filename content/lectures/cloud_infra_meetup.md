In november 2017 I was on [Cloud infra meetup #5](https://www.meetup.com/cloudinfra/events/244030502/)
in Warsaw.

Together with [Pawe≈Ç Suder](http://pawel.suder.info/pl/) we talked about OVH
Public Cloud solutions.

I talked there about how we integrate in OVH OpenStack networking solutions
(based on Neutron) with some internal OVH solutions like e.g.
[vRack](https://www.ovh.co.uk/solutions/vrack/).

Lecture was given in polish but
[slides](https://slawqo.github.io/cloud-infra-5/#1) are available in english.

Slides' source is available on my
[Github](https://github.com/slawqo/cloud-infra-5)
